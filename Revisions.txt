Change Log

1.5.3.0
-------------
-- fixed issue where going to a new file didn't clear out the prior maps regions
-- fixed issue where selecting multiple rooms wasn't being visually indicated.  It used to indicate by changing the fill color of the room, but I now just change the border color to the select line color in the settings.
