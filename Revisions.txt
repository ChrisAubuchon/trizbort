Change Log

1.5.6.0
-------------
++ item text inside a colored region uses the room text color.

1.5.5.0
-------------
++ Ctrl-Arrow keys will create room in that cardinal direction from the current room.  This just seemed natural.  Numpad Ctrl-Arrow keys still work (and only way to do diagonals)
++ Regions are now supported in the export to Inform 7
++ Automap feature now has a special "region" command to add a region from a transcript.
++ Select two rooms, hit 'J' and they are combined in a sensible way based on positioning.
++ Tooltips added when hovering over objects on the canvas.

1.5.4.0
-------------
-- fixed bug that the copy feature was not copying the region.
-- fixed bug that would crash Trizbort if the PDF was opened when trying to export to PDF (or SmartSave)
-- a new region text color now defaulted to text color in settings.
-- when saving a map to an image, there is a app setting that will ignore the zoom level and save at 100%
++ added a small zoom indicator to the map.

1.5.3.0
-------------
-- fixed issue where going to a new file didn't clear out the prior maps regions
-- fixed issue where selecting multiple rooms wasn't being visually indicated.  It used to indicate by changing the fill color of the room, but I now just change the border color to the select line color in the settings.
++ Added a right-click context menu.  Currently can change region of room and can change the dark status (works on multiple selected rooms)

1.5.2.0
-------------
++ Allow user to change the region text color.

1.5.1.0
-------------
++ show filenames that are saved during the SmartSave
++ more reliable way to choose filenames for SmartSave, should fix the occasional issue where if two instances of Trizbort open, the filenames could get confused.

1.5.0.0
-------------
This initial build is based off the last build from Genstein.  It also pulls in a few other forks that had some useful features.

++ Adds the ability to split a rooms color 50/50.  [Room Properties Dialog]
++ Ability to copy / paste of elements.

== Issue with large maps locking up or slow loading when opening.

This also pulls from the tustin2121 fork which adds a few small features.

++ App settings dialog
++ Added invert mouse wheel setting
++ added canvas drag mouse button setting.

Then this adds some of my own changes.

++ Added Smart Save feature which will save PDF and image file in one click to the project folder.
++ Added a default image type in app settings that Smart Save uses for saving the image.
++ Now you can add regions.  Regions can be setup in the map settings dialog, named and a color assigned to it.
++ In the room properties, you can now assign a room to a region.  This will show the room in the region color assigned to the region.
